## 📱 Android App Features
- **Modern UI**: Designed entirely with Jetpack Compose for intuitive and dynamic layouts.
- **Offline Caching**: Supports offline access using Paging 3 with Remote Mediator and Room.
- **Custom Components**: Built-in custom UI widgets such as Rating Widget, Search Bar, and Swipe to Refresh.
- **Dynamic Themes**: Light and dark themes with dynamic colors extracted from images via the Palette API.
- **Smooth Animations**: Includes an animated splash screen to enhance the user experience.

## 🔗 Backend Features with Ktor
- **REST API**: A lightweight, Kotlin-based server that handles client requests and sends responses.
- **Serialization**: Ktor’s built-in serialization for efficient data handling.
- **Static Content & Headers**: Manage static content and custom headers with ease.
- **Testing**: Fully tested server endpoints to ensure reliable communication with the client app.
- **Heroku Deployment**: Ready for deployment on platforms like Heroku.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
### Android
- **Jetpack Compose**: Build UI with Kotlin’s modern UI toolkit.
- **Paging 3 & Room**: Implement paging with local caching for offline support.
- **Retrofit**: Handle HTTP requests and communicate with the backend API.
- **Coil**: Load images efficiently in the app.
- **Dagger-Hilt/Koin**: Dependency Injection for cleaner architecture.

### Backend
- **Ktor**: Framework for building the backend server with Kotlin and Coroutines.
- **KotlinX Serialization**: Efficient data serialization and deserialization.
- **Postman**: Test API endpoints to ensure smooth communication.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites for testing
1. **Android Studio**: Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed.
2. **Kotlin**: The app and backend server are written in Kotlin.
3. **Heroku CLI**: For backend deployment.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   
2. Navigate to the Android project and open it in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on your device or emulator.

# Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend folder and set up Ktor:
./gradlew run
2. Test the API endpoints using Postman or cURL.
   
## ✨ Highlights
# Custom UI Components
Includes a custom Rating Widget, dynamic colors, and much more.
# Clean Architecture
Follows MVVM and Clean Architecture principles for easy scalability and testing.
# Cross-platform Kotlin
Uses Kotlin on both the backend (Ktor) and Android sides for a unified codebase.


# 🌐 Deployment
Easily deploy the Ktor backend to Heroku using the following command:

git push heroku main

## 🧪 Testing
Backend: Test all server endpoints using Postman.
Android: Unit tests for key components, UI tests for custom widgets.
